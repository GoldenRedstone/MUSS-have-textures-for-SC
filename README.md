# MUSS-have-textures-for-SC

We make unique, personalised, and custom items for each customer!
Do you want custom elytra, tools, armour, totems, and items like they have on Hermitcraft?
Perhaps you want to carry around a mini version of yourself or your friends.
If so, this is the texture pack for you!

## How it works
Everyone is able to have unique, custom items by using a specific resource pack.
Renaming an item will change its appearance for EVERYONE using the resource pack.

## How to get/use it
1. Install CIT Resewn for Fabric or Optifine for Forge.
2. Download the latest version of the resource pack from Github or by sending me a DM.
3. Add and enable the resource pack in-game via Options>Resource Packs.
4. Rename an item according to the item catalogue.

You may need to disable your cape to view the correct elytra texture.

## Placing an order
To place an order for a custom item just send me a message. You can find me on Discord as GoldenRedstone#8843 or ingame under the same name.
I'm unable to do modelling at this point in time but if you provide it, I will include it in the pack.
## Adding to the pack
Adding to the pack is simple, just send the texture or model, and specify the item and name.
Alternatively send over a resource pack and I will include it in the next distribution of the pack.
