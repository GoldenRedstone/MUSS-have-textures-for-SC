# MUSS-have-textures-for-SC

Bringing you fancy textures since season 3!

We make unique, personalised, and custom items for each customer!
Do you want custom elytra, totems, and items like they have on Hermitcraft?
Do you want coloured elytra or trimmed tools?
Perhaps you want to carry around a mini version of yourself or your friends.
If so, this is the texture pack for you!

## How it works
Everyone can have unique, custom items by using a specific resource pack.
Renaming an item will change its appearance for EVERYONE using the resource pack.

## How to get/use it
1. Install CIT Resewn for Fabric or Optifine for Forge.
2. Download the latest version of the resource pack from the releases page.
3. Add and enable the resource pack in-game via Options>Resource Packs.
4. Rename an item according to the item catalogue.

You may need to disable your cape to view the correct elytra texture.

### Optional:
- Download Respackopts to change pack settings.

## Placing an order
To place an order for a custom item just send me a message. You can find me on Discord as GoldenRedstone#8843 or ingame under the same name.
## Adding to the pack
Adding to the pack is simple, just send the texture or model, and specify the item and name.
Alternatively, send over a resource pack and I will include it in the next distribution of the pack.
If you know how to use GitHub you can also create a pull request with your changes.
